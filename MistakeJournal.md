# Mistake Journal

This is a document to keep track of my mistakes as I learn how to code through Epicodus. I decided to use Markdown because I didn't get enough time or pay close enough attention when I went through the tutorial and I need more practice. Also, it's a convenient code to use. In each entry, I will document the date, where I was, and what I was doing, before writing any entries, so that it is easier to keep track of past mistakes. As with a blog, the first entry will be the most recent.

Each time I make a mistake I will write down what the problem was (including any error messages), what steps I took to fix it, and what eventually worked.

Woodstock Library & Home - Reading and Git practice

Last week, at home and in class, I had a really hard time with Git, so today I will be spending extra time on Git, so that I don't fall behind. I have a good grasp on what Git is and its purpose, but I struggled more with practice.
